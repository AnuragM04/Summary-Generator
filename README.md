# Summary-Generator
Text and Audio Summary Generator for Documents

In today's fast-paced academic environment, students often struggle to efficiently revise large
volumes of study materials within a limited time, especially during examinations. Manual
summarization of notes or textbooks is time-consuming and often leads to incomplete
understanding. This project addresses this challenge by developing an *Automatic Summary
Generator for Study Materials* using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The
system allows users to upload study materials in the form of PDF files or raw text, processes the
content through a pre-trained NLP model (such as BART or T5), and generates concise, accurate
summaries that highlight key points and essential information.
The generated summaries are presented in a readable format, providing students with a quick
way to review large topics. Additionally, the project is extended with optional features like
keyword extraction, quiz generation, and text-to-speech conversion, which further enhance the
learning experience by enabling audio-based revision and active recall. By automating the
summarization process, this tool reduces the time spent on manual note-making and helps
students focus on understanding core concepts. Overall, this NLP-based system acts as a smart
study assistant, boosting productivity, making exam preparation more efficient, and supporting
smarter learning.
